Quoted from zeromq [docs](https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter1/):

> Programming is science dressed up as art because most of us don’t understand the physics of software and it’s rarely, if ever, taught.
> The physics of software is not algorithms, data structures, languages and abstractions.
> These are just tools we make, use, throw away.
> The real physics of software is the physics of people–specifically, our limitations when it comes to complexity, and our desire to work together to solve large problems in pieces.
> This is the science of programming: make building blocks that people can understand and use easily, and people will work together to solve the very largest problems.
