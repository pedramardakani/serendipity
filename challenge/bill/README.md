# Exchange amount using specific bills

Suppose we have a hypothetical currency of Odlars you're told to change 8
Odolars with only 1, 2, and 5 Odolar bills. In how many ways could you do
that?

## To do

- [ ] 🧪 add unit tests for a few other cases, currently I've tested this for:

  1. Changing $8 with ($1, $2, and $5) bills

  2. Changing $8 with ($1, $2, $3, and $5) bills

- [ ] 🧑‍🏭 refactor! The procedure is not super clear to new readers
