# Challenge

Some nice coding challenges.

## [Bill](bill/): exchange amount using specific bills

Example: there are 5 possible ways of paying $8 with $1, $3, and $5 bills

## [Multiples](multiples/): what are the multiples of a given set under a target number?

Example: multiples of 3 and 5, below 10 would be: [3, 5, 6, 9]

## [Convert Python dictionary to XML](dictionary-to-xml):

Use each dicitonary item `key` as opening and closing tags, and sandwich the value in between.

Examples:

1. `{"foo": "bar"}` should return:
   `"<foo>bar</foo>"`

2. `{"foo": [1, 2, 3]}` should return:
   `"<foo><item>1</item><item>2</item><item>3</item></foo>"`
